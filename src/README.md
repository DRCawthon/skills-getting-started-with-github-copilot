## Data Model

The application uses a simple data model with meaningful identifiers:

1. **Activities** - Uses activity name as identifier:

   - Description
   - Schedule
   - Maximum number of participants allowed
   - List of student emails who are signed up

2. **Students** - Uses email as identifier:
   - Name
   - Grade level

All data is stored in memory, which means data will be reset when the server restarts.

## Testing

The application includes a comprehensive test suite to ensure all functionality works as expected. To run the tests:

```bash
python -m pytest
```

For test coverage information:

```bash
python -m pytest --cov=src tests/
```

See the [tests README](../tests/README.md) for more information about the test suite.
